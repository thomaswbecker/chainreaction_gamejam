When your ship left port, everything was fine and you had a full complement of crew on board.  Fine, that is, until a band of stowaways came out from hiding and murdered the crew, intent on taking over the ship.  The ship is listing uncontrollably because there's a storm and no one is at the helm.  The bad guys are all hunting for you, the sole survivor.  Your mission is to get to the ship's bridge and regain control of the ship.  

On the way, you're going to have to take out some bad guys.  You are unarmed but you happen to be an explosives expert and during your retreat through the ship, you've rigged key barrels to explode to eliminate the pursuing bad guys.  The detonators have a delay timer.  Click them to detonate at the right moment and set off a chain reaction to kill the bad guys and clear a path to the ship's bridge where you'll take the helm and sail to safety.  

Good luck!
